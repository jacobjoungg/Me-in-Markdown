I am very extroverted so I am very outgoing with people that I first meet. I love to watch movies with friends and rate the movies on an app called Letterboxd. I enjoy eating good food like burgers, wings, and other american food. I like traveling with friends and family to experience the world. 

Summer Travel Experiences
Last spring, I went to New York City where I was able to lay my eyes on some of the world's most coolest buildings. I was able to visit the 9/11 memorial where people gathered to remember those who were killed in the tragic attack. I also was able to go to the Empire State Building and see the amazing view of the whole city. I was able to eat some of the best pizza and other really good food out in New York. I was able to experience the Times Square in full effect during the evening in NYC. Lastly, I was able to visit the famous Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge where I was able to take a ferry across the Atlantic Ocean and step foot on Liberty Island. 

Sport Acivities
I enjoy lots of sports. I enjoy playing basketball and volleyball especially for my high school teams. I enjoy being able to compete against my friends that go to different schools and it lets me be able to continue to stay in shape. I like playing sports because I love being active and moving around instead of just sitting around and doing things like read. I also like the feeling of winning. The feeling of winning is a big reason I love playing sports because after a win, I feel pleasure.
