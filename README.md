Summer Travel Experiences
Last spring, I went to New York City where I was able to lay my eyes on some of the world's most coolest buildings. I was able to visit the 9/11 memorial where people gathered to remember those who were killed in the tragic attack. I also was able to go to the Empire State Building and see the amazing view of the whole city. I was able to eat some of the best pizza and other really good food out in New York. I was able to experience the Times Square in full effect during the evening in NYC. Lastly, I was able to visit the famous Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge where I was able to take a ferry across the Atlantic Ocean and step foot on Liberty Island.
